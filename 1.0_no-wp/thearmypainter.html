            <p>The famous and ground-breaking Quickshade is a pigmented varnish which will shade your miniatures perfectly and still let the colours come through. Painting armies of miniatures to fantastic results has never been easier - especially if you combine this high quality product with the revolutionary Colour Primers.</p>
            <p>This product has been specifically designed and engineered to work with 10-28mm. miniatures and should not be confused with the many dodgy floor varnishes or shoe polishes...</p>
            <p>This products sole purpose is for use with miniatures ONLY, and although it could possibly be used on a floor or a pair of shoes as well, we do not recommend it!</p>
            <p>The technique of dipping is not new. Shading your miniatures with a single dip is old, especially within the historical scene - but finally, a product which will shade your army perfectly and is fantastically easy to use - just have a look at every single Gallery on this site - you will not be disappointed!</p>
