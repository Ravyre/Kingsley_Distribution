      <p>The fate of the world hangs not on armies but on individual heroes; men and women of extraordinary capacity, attuned to the all-permeating life force known as Ki. This force is the very fabric of the universe, and those with the appropriate training or natural talent can tap into this energy source and gain seemingly superhuman powers. In this world, the delicate tapestry of Ki – and thus the universe itself – is threatened by the forces of imbalance, and it is up to these remarkable heroes to protect it or help rip it apart.
      Nothing less than the universe itself is at stake; are you ready for the challenge of the Way of the Warrior?</p>

      <h2>About</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Rise of the Kage is a game for 2 - 4 players where players can choose to play as the ninja of the Shadow Wind Clan (Kage Kaze Zoku); warriors tasked with a variety of missions all ultimately focused upon taking down the Takashi clan. Or as the guards of the Prefecture of Ryu; warriors who have sworn their lives to protect the Daimyo. </p>
    <p>Whether you choose to play as ninjas or guards, all players will be faced difficult decisions. Ninja will have to choose between recklessly forcing their way through their opponents whilst undoubtedly raising the alarm level, or approach their mission slowly and stealthily while potentially losing the advantage that night brings. All the while the guards will be left to decide as to whether to throw themselves in the way of their more deadly rivals or strategically attempt to slow them down.</p>
    <p>Rise of the Kage offers a great blend of sneaky skills and gobsmacking kills.</p>
