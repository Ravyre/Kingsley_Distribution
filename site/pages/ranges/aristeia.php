      <p>One hundred and seventy five years into the future, the human race has reached the stars. The ancient nations have gathered into immense, international, federated blocks and have divided the star systems proved suitable for human life. The most advanced medicine makes it possible to extend life and, together with the most advanced (and most expensive) technology, almost reach corporeal immortality. It also allows treats such as the most popular extreme contact sport: Aristeia!, a series of high-level, armed combats where death is a real possibility.</p>
