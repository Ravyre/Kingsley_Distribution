        <h2>Bushido</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The fate of the world hangs not on armies but on individual heroes; men and women of extraordinary capacity, attuned to the all-permeating life force known as Ki. This force is the very fabric of the universe, and those with the appropriate training or natural talent can tap into this energy source and gain seemingly superhuman powers. In this world, the delicate tapestry of Ki – and thus the universe itself – is threatened by the forces of imbalance, and it is up to these remarkable heroes to protect it or help rip it apart.
      Nothing less than the universe itself is at stake; are you ready for the challenge of the Way of the Warrior?</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Bushido is a fantasy skirmish game by <a href="https://gctstudios.com/">GCT Studios</a> that draws influence from Asia. The Jwar Isles, where the game is set, consists of many different groups all vying for power.</p>
      <p>Each player commands a force of no more than a handful of individuals, represented by 32mm metal miniatures. These forces meet on the battlefield and the commanders (the players, that is) try to outwit, outfight and outlive the opposing force and fulfil their battle objectives while denying the enemy theirs.</p>
      <p>A game of Bushido is fast-moving, flexible and filled with strategizing, counter-strategizing and counter-counter-strategizing. Your tactical acumen is important, but as dice add an element of randomness, so too is your ability to think on your feet.</p>
