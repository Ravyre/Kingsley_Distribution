      <h2>It is the Year 2670</h2>
    </div>
    <p>A Golden Age of humanity has passed into history. A time when mankind advanced implacably and unopposed through the stars has gone beyond living memory.</p>
    <p>Planet Earth and the original Cradle Worlds are lost to the great foe, the Scourge. The shattering invasion of this terrible enemy has torn the domains of man asunder.</p>
    <p>The remnants of human civilisation now exist in a collection of frontier planets. Thinly spread and underdeveloped, they are pale shadows of mankind's former glories.</p>
    <p>However, this is not an age without hope. Humanity has found new strength, unity and purpose in these times of dire fortune. The colonies are undertaking a period of vigorous, dynamic expansion, unrivalled in the history of our race, united by a common purpose - Reconquest.</p>
    <p>The armies of the United Colonies of Mankind march towards humanities' former heartland, battling the dreaded Scourge one world at a time. Many enemies and allies await on this journey; an odyssey through the stars towards a distant and glittering goal - Earth.</p>

      <h2>About</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Dropzone Commander is a 10mm scale sci-fi tabletop wargame, devised for mass battles between two or more players.</p>
    <p>The rules are based on an alternate activation system, which keeps the action constant and involving. They are designed for fast and dynamic games, and do not rely heavily on pages of reference tables. The rules are also scalable, and will cater for tactical skirmishes as well as titanic clashes of metal and firepower. This is accomplished without sacrificing the character of individual units, and indeed all the colour and eventfulness of battle.</p>

      <h2>Scenery</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Battlefields of the future are hardly ever featureless wastelands, and normally include various kinds of scenery which can strongly affect the game. Indeed, dropzone is best played on a table with plenty of scenery, which almost always makes a game more interesting, tactical and varied.</p>

  <p>Players take command of one of four factions in an effort to ensure the fate of the Galaxy; battles are fast paced and dynamic, with Dropships deploying and re-deploying units throughout the course of the engagement. This leads to tough tactical choices and exciting combat action.</p>
  <p>Dropzone already an immensely popular game with a large fan base; there is plenty to keep veteran players engrossed and inviting enough for new players to get involved.</p>
