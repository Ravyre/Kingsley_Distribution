      <h2>Wolsung</h2>
    </div>
    <p>These are the extraordinary times of Magical-Industrial Revolution. In Lyonesse, the city of cities, sky is crowded with airships and steam-powered automobiles race the streets.<p>
    <p>Elven aristocrats from their gentelmen's clubs plot intricate intrigues. Workshops and factories spawn mad scientists' mechanical golems and cabalistic thinking machines. Halfling mobsters and orc triads fight their war in backalleys and docks. In the dark corners of the city, unnoticed by the warring clubs, the undead rise their heads planning to bring back horrors of the Great War.</p>
    <p>These daring times demand extraordinary heroes. And sometimes even ‘extraordinary’ is just not enough!</p>

      <h2>About</h2>
    </div>
    <p>The Wolsung Steampunk Skirmish Game is a 28mm miniature combat game, where clubs of extraordinary ladies and gentlemen, as well as shadowy organisations and agents of obscure powers, solve their disputes by blade and gunshot rather than discussion. Each game represents a point where paths of two or more such clubs cross while they work on the same goal, but for opposite purpose. As such, the careful deduction and data gathering as well as social meetings that led them to this point are left for Wolsung Roleplay narrative; A game of Wolsung Skirmish represents the point where the outcome is decided by a keen eye, reflexes and a bit of luck.</p>
    <p>Wolsung presents an alternative version of our world at the end of the 19th century, a version strongly influenced by adventure novels, penny dreadfuls, action movies, video games and comic books. The world is familiar enough, so you will not feel out of place, and at the same time it has the freshness, dash and magic that will compel you to explore it during your game sessions. The World Tour presents the setting of the game: its history, geography, technology, as well as details on everyday life in the daring times of Magical-Industrial Revolution.</p>

      <div>
        <p>The official Wolsung scenery by Microart are made of HDF (high-density fiberboard). Most people are familar with MDF but HDF is stronger, denser and more versitile.</p>
        <p>The scenery is designed to slot together in a way that enables a quick and easy assembly. It may be necessary to glue some parts of the models - use PVA (white) glue. Every model is cut from one or more panels of HDF (high-density fiberboard) of 3mm thickness.</p>
        <p>All HDF scenery will arrive unassembled and unpainted leaving your imagination to design and developer the buildings to suite your own personal gaming board.</p>
