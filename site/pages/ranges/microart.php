        <p>The comic fantasy book series is based on the fictional Discworld, a flat disc which balances on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle known as the Great A'Tuin. The Discworld book series has succeeded in capturing the imaginations of millions of people since the first book in 1983.</p>
        <p>Microart have done the series proud with their beautifully crafted metal miniatures. Each and every Discworld miniature is oozing with character and made to an extremely high quality at 30mm scale. These stunning miniatures will not look out of place alongside any fan's Discworld collection.</p>

      <h2>Scenery</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>There are a couple of varieties in Microart scenery to choose from. There is beautifully cast resin pieces, hard-wearing and highly impressive HDF buildings, and finally lightweight but durable hardfoam.</p>
      <p>Resin scenery is fantastic due to the fact that it can contain more detail per piece that isn't as achieveable with HDF or Hardfoam.</p>
      <p>HDF stands for High Density Firbreboard; most people are familiar with MDF, HDF is very similar except that is it denser and more versatile than MDF. The additions of laser etched details really add depth and detail to enhance the finished, painted product.</p>
      <p>Hard Foam is amazing because it's lightweight, durable and easy to cut with a knife to make any alterations to add a uniqueness to your scenery that sets it apart from everyone else's.</p>
      <p>All scenery will work well with any 28mm scale miniature game.</p>

      <h2>Mats</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Microart Studio mats are like a work of art; they are beautiful. But their beauty doesn't compromise their durability. Microart Studio mats are highly praised for the added quality the art brings to the gaming table all the while being able to stand up against continuous heavy use.</p>
      <p>All mats are made with a polyester and rubber mixture. The top half of the mat is a high quality printout on polyester surface, while the bottom half is made out of rubber to prevent it slipping on a table surface. You may find that it is similar to "mousepad" material.</p>

      <h2>Wild West Exodus</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Wild West Exodus is a dynamic, fast-paced tabletop miniatures game pitting a cast of heroic characters against each other in a brutal world - very much a twisted reflection of our own.</p>
      <p>No Ninteenth Centuary battleground would be complete without the impressive HDF buildings and hardfoam scenery pieces expertly designed at Microart.</p>
      <p>The houses and other buildings that you’re seeing here are all a slightly larger scale than you might have seen from Micro Art Studios in the past, especially with their Infinity buildings. This is because the whole scale of Wild West Exodus is bigger coming in at 35mm, so it had to be!</p>
